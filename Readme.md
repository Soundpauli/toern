# TŒRN [tɜːn]:
**DIY Open-Source Hardware Sampler-Sequencer**  
A sequenced driven musical device for beginners, makers and enthusiasts.


---

## INTRODUCING TŒRN  
The TŒRN (spoken as: [tɜːn]) builds on the legacy of the NI404 with **enhanced features**, a streamlined design, and superior functionality. From upgraded RGB-I2C rotary encoders to a custom PCB with everything pre-assembled, tœrn_x408 is designed to be the ultimate **DIY sampler-sequencer**—accessible, powerful, and inspiring.  

No more additional cables or extensions: every component is directly mounted on the PCB, ensuring ease of assembly and a clean build. With **new connectivity options**, expanded audio capabilities, and an updated design, this device is ready to meet the needs of modern music creators.

## WHAT'S NEW IN TŒRN 

- **Upgraded Encoders**: High-quality RGB-I2C rotary encoders for smoother and more precise control.  
- **Custom PCB**: Fully assembled, simplifying the building process—just order and put it together.  
- **USB-C Port**: Replacing micro-USB for faster and more reliable connectivity.  
- **Battery Charging Port**: Added support for internal LiPo batteries (not included) for true portability.  
- **Expanded Audio I/O**:  
  - **6.35mm headphone output** for studio-grade monitoring.  
  - **Line-in and line-out jacks (6.35mm)** for external audio integration.  
  - **Mic-in (6.35mm)** for vocal recording.  
  - **Built-in internal microphone** for direct sampling without extra hardware.  
- **TRS MIDI In/Out Ports**: Enhanced MIDI capabilities for seamless integration into larger setups.  
- **On/Off Switch**: Power control for added convenience.  
- **Touch Buttons**: For enabling advanced features and future expansions.  
- **New Casing**: Laser-cut acrylic housing for a polished, durable finish (files included).  
- **No soldering required**: All connections are JST-Connectors for easy building

## FEATURES  

- **Playful Design**: Inspired by the Etch-A-Sketch™ for intuitive and beginner-friendly music creation.  
- **Vivid 16x16 RGB LED Grid**: Dynamic visual feedback for a seamless creative process.  
- **Real-Time Control**: Adjust parameters like BPM, volume, effects, and more on the fly—ideal for live performances.  
- **Customizable Workflow**: Load your own samples (WAV format) via SD card. Supports up to 8 voices and an additional onboard synth voice.  

- **Powerful Sequencer**:  
- Autosave/autoload functionality for convenience.  
- Sample Browser: Manage up to 999 samples from the SD card in real-time and during playback  
- 16-bar patterns across 16 pages (256 bars per song).  

- 8 parallel sample voices with added effects: ADSR-envelope, bitcrusher, filter (high/low/pass), flanger (4X), reverb (4x), each voice can freely assign one of the 999 samples
- With added effects: ADSR-envelope, flanger, bitcrusher, filter (high/low/pass), flanger, reverb
- All samples can be cut to size for each voice indiviually (start/end) befor loading to voice
- Recording inbuild-mic/line-in/mic-in directly in sample browser for quick access (input via settings page)
- Possibility to save / merge used samples as samplepack to SD card for easy access
  
- Changing /loading up to 100 samplepacks live during runtime/playing without stopping
- Changing /loading up to 100 patterns or songs live during runtime/playing without stopping
- Selecting global midi-TRS-in-channel (1-16)
- Global midi-TRS out (1-14, for voice 1-14)
- Selecting single midi-TRS out channel (1-16) if output-channel should be fixed / pinned down to a single voice
- Clock: 40 - 300bpm, you can change between send the local or receive an external MIDI-Clock (via TRS)

- Copy+paste of current view/page
- Intelligent random notes generation (based on maj/min) tonescale as well as rythm per page
- Transposing and/or shifting current channel / current page within (+/- 1 octave)
- Delete all notes / current channel notes of a page via shortcut

- **Synth and Filter Features**:
- 3 of the Sample Voices can be switched to each one of three analog drum voices (bassdrum, snare and highhat), each with tonehight / decay / freqency manupilation
- 1 three-voice synth with 3 OSCs per voice with added effects: ADSR-envelope, flanger, bitcrusher, filter (high/low/pass), flanger, reverb
- 2 one-voiced synths with each 2 OSCs with added effects: ADSR-envelope, flanger, bitcrusher, filter (high/low/pass), flanger, reverb
- 1 assignable default filter for each channel which can be easily directly accessed during runtime on encoder #3
