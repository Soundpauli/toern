# Effects & parameters

Per-channel FX and synth parameters are stored in `SMP` tables and applied by dedicated modules.

## Modules

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `toern_filter.ino` | `setFilters`, mixer gain smoothing, filter transitions |
| `toern_filterUI.ino` | Matrix sliders, pages, encoder colors for filter mode |
| `toern_parameters.ino` | `setParams`, defaults, envelope/synth default packs, reset |

## FX chain (conceptual)

For a typical sample channel:

**envelope → bitcrusher → filter → freeverb → mixers → output**

This reverb path exists on sample voices 1, 2 and 5–8. Samples 3 and 4 bypass reverb. Poly voice 11 has a shared bitcrusher/filter/reverb chain after its oscillator/ladder stages; mono voices 13 and 14 have bitcrusher/filter stages without reverb.

## UI value vs audio value

The matrix usually shows **0–32** (or enums as text). Mapping functions convert those into Hz, resonance, wet/dry, bit depth, etc. When adding a parameter:

1. Extend the settings array / `FilterType` or related enum if needed.
2. Teach `setFilters` / `setParams` the mapping.
3. Add a slider definition for filter UI (`SliderDefEntry` / name index tables).
4. Keep display enums in sync with `enumNames` pointers.

## Sample page 1 — TIME

On sample channels, filter UI page 1 includes **TIME** (`ARR_STRETCH`): independent WSOLA time-stretch, separate from OCTV/DTNE pitch. Default **11 = off**. Implementation and player wiring are covered under [Samples](./samples#time--independent-stretch-wsola).

## Fast filter encoder

During play, encoder #3 can adjust a per-channel “default fast filter” target (`defaultFastFilter`, `setDefaultFastFilterValue`) without entering full filter mode — useful when tracing runtime parameter paths.
